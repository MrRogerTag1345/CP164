2021 is finally here, which means we get a bunch of cars from the year 1996 that can be legally 
imported to the USA. These cars were never originally sold in America, but thanks to the 25 year 
law we can bring em in starting now! Weâ€™ve got cars and trucks from Japan, Europe, and even 
Australia. This is The D-List!
